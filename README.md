3arthh4ck is Minecraft 1.12.2 utility mod for anarchy PvP. With the 1.7.0 release it also takes over the role of the now outdated PingBypass Server and Client. To install it just drop the jar into your forge mods folder. By default, any message prefixed with a + will be handled as command, e.g. +toggle clickgui, to open the gui. Because of bloat I decided to hide some of the more complicated Settings by default. You can find those by using the Settings modul
